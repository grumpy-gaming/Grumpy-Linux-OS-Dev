Roadmap Update!

Let's mark off that milestone:

Phase 1: Core System Foundation

    1.1 Set up Build Environment & Workspace
        ✅ Prerequisites on Host System (Ubuntu in WSL) installed.
        ✅ Created ~/grumpy-Linux-OS-Dev as Git repository root.
        ✅ Moved ~/grumpy into ~/Grumpy-Linux-OS-Dev/grumpy (this is $LFS).
        ✅ Set LFS environment variable to ~/Grumpy-Linux-OS-Dev/grumpy in ~/.bashrc.
        ✅ Created $LFS/tools directory.
        ✅ Created $LFS/sources directory.
        ✅ Downloaded all source packages (Binutils, GCC, Glibc, Kernel, MPC, MPFR, GMP).
        ✅ Unpacked all source packages.
        ✅ Established Git repository in ~/Grumpy-Linux-OS-Dev/ and linked to GitHub (Grumpy-Linux-OS-Dev).
        ✅ Configured .gitignore to exclude build artifacts.
        ✅ Created README.md, LICENSE.md, etc., locally.
        ✅ Configured SSH authentication for GitHub.
        ✅ GIT MILESTONE: Commit & Push "Initial project setup and Git integration."

    1.2 Build Cross-Compilation Toolchain (Pass 1)
        ✅ Binutils - Pass 1: Compiled and installed minimal binutils into $LFS/tools.
        ✅ GCC - Pass 1: Compiled and installed minimal C-only gcc (static libgcc) into $LFS/tools.

    1.3 Build Glibc (The C Standard Library)
        ✅ Created essential base directories within $LFS (e.g., /usr, /usr/include, /lib, etc.).
        ✅ Installed Linux Kernel Headers into $LFS/usr/include.
        ✅ Cleaned glibc build directory (rm -rf build).
        ✅ Temporarily hid host g++ to prevent glibc from attempting C++ builds.
        ✅ Configured glibc.
        ✅ Compiled glibc.
        ✅ Installed glibc to $LFS using DESTDIR=$LFS.
        ✅ Restored host g++ to its original name.
        ✅ GIT MILESTONE: Commit & Push "Completed Glibc Pass 1 installation and prepared LFS environment for final toolchain build." (You're ready for this push)

    1.4 Build Self-Hosting Toolchain (Pass 2)
        ⏳ Adjust PATH: Changed PATH in ~/.bashrc to prioritize $LFS/bin and $LFS/usr/bin.
        ⏳ Binutils - Pass 2: Clean, Configure, Compile, and Install the final binutils to $LFS/usr.
        ⬜ GCC - Pass 2: Clean, Configure, Compile, and Install the final gcc (including C++ support) to $LFS/usr.
        ⬜ GIT MILESTONE: Commit & Push "Final self-hosting toolchain built."

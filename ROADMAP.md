Grumpy Linux Build Roadmap & Progress Checklist

Overall Project Goals:

    ✅ Build a fully independent Linux system from source
    ✅ Utilize Debian-based package management for stability
    ✅ Optimize for high-performance gaming and development workflows
    ✅ Develop a distinct dark-mode UI with blues and greens
    ✅ Provide future KDE/XFCE forks for customization

Current Status: You've successfully built Glibc, and you are currently performing a Git commit and push for that milestone, after which you'll resume building Binutils Pass 2.

Detailed Roadmap & Progress Checklist:

Phase 1: Core System Foundation

    1.1 Set up Build Environment & Workspace
        ✅ Prerequisites on Host System (Ubuntu in WSL) installed.
        ✅ Created ~/grumpy-project as Git repository root.
        ✅ Moved ~/grumpy into ~/grumpy-project/grumpy (this is your $LFS directory).
        ✅ Set LFS environment variable to ~/grumpy-project/grumpy in ~/.bashrc.
        ✅ Created $LFS/tools directory.
        ✅ Created $LFS/sources directory.
        ✅ Downloaded all necessary source packages (Binutils, GCC, Glibc, Kernel, MPC, MPFR, GMP).
        ✅ Unpacked all source packages.
        ✅ Initialized Git in ~/grumpy-project/ and linked to your GitHub GrumpyLinux repository.
        ✅ Configured .gitignore to exclude build artifacts.
        ✅ Pulled existing README.md, LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, images/ from GitHub.
        ✅ Updated README.md locally with project details.
        ✅ Configured SSH authentication for GitHub.
        ✅ GIT MILESTONE: Commit & Push "Initial project setup and Git integration."

    1.2 Build Cross-Compilation Toolchain (Pass 1)
        ✅ Binutils - Pass 1: Compiled and installed minimal binutils into $LFS/tools.
        ✅ GCC - Pass 1: Compiled and installed minimal C-only gcc (static libgcc) into $LFS/tools.

    1.3 Build Glibc (The C Standard Library)
        ✅ Created essential base directories within $LFS (e.g., /usr, /usr/include, /lib, etc.).
        ✅ Installed Linux Kernel Headers into $LFS/usr/include.
        ✅ Cleaned glibc build directory (rm -rf build).
        ✅ Temporarily hid host g++ to prevent glibc from attempting C++ builds.
        ✅ Configured glibc.
        ✅ Compiled glibc.
        ✅ Installed glibc to $LFS using DESTDIR=$LFS.
        ✅ Restored host g++ to its original name.
        ✅ GIT MILESTONE: Commit & Push "Completed Glibc Pass 1 installation and prepared LFS environment for final toolchain build." (You are completing this push now)

    1.4 Build Self-Hosting Toolchain (Pass 2)
        ⏳ Adjust PATH: Changed PATH in ~/.bashrc to prioritize $LFS/bin and $LFS/usr/bin.
        ⏳ Binutils - Pass 2: Clean, Configure, Compile, and Install the final binutils to $LFS/usr. (You should be starting this after the current push)
        ⬜ GCC - Pass 2: Clean, Configure, Compile, and Install the final gcc (including C++ support) to $LFS/usr.
        ⬜ GIT MILESTONE: Commit & Push "Final self-hosting toolchain built."

    1.5 Build Essential System Utilities
        ⬜ Linux-Headers - Pass 2: (Minor re-installation if needed for some tools' build requirements).
        ⬜ Tcl/Expect/DejaGNU: (If needed for testing other tools)
        ⬜ Binutils (again): (A quick re-install for necessary /bin/ld symlink).
        ⬜ Coreutils: Essential command-line utilities (ls, cp, mv, etc.).
        ⬜ Diffutils: For comparing files.
        ⬜ File: For identifying file types.
        ⬜ Findutils: For finding files.
        ⬜ Grep: For searching text.
        ⬜ Gzip: For compression.
        ⬜ M4: Macro processor.
        ⬜ Make: Build automation tool.
        ⬜ Patch: Apply changes to files.
        ⬜ Perl: Scripting language.
        ⬜ Sed: Stream editor.
        ⬜ Tar: Archiving tool.
        ⬜ Xz/Bzip2: Compression tools.
        ⬜ Zstd: Fast compression.
        ⬜ Bash: The shell itself.
        ⬜ Core Libraries (e.g., Zlib, Bzip2, Xz, OpenSSL, libcap, GMP, MPFR, MPC, etc.): Rebuild these for the final environment if they weren't fully integrated.
        ⬜ GIT MILESTONE: Commit & Push "Essential system utilities built."

Phase 2: Boot & System Tools

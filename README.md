Overview

Grumpy

Linux is an independent Linux distribution designed for performance,

customization, and a sleek aesthetic. Unlike standard Linux from Scratch

builds, this project constructs a unique OS from the ground

up—compiling core components, designing a custom package system, and

optimizing for gaming and development.


Goals

✅ Build a fully independent Linux system from source


✅ Utilize Debian-based package management for stability


✅ Optimize for high-performance gaming and development workflows


✅ Develop a distinct dark-mode UI with blues and greens


✅ Provide future KDE/XFCE forks for customization

Roadmap

Phase 1: Core System Foundation

Configure toolchain and compiler setup

Compile custom Linux kernel

Set up Debian package management integration

Build minimal userland utilities

Phase 2: Boot & System Tools
